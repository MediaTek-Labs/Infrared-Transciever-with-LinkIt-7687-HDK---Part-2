@par Overview

 - Example project description
   - The project is a simple demonstration program to show
   			- how to connect to (Mediatek Cloud Sandbox (MCS) cloud service
   			- how to receive data from MCS cloud service
   			- how to send IR PWD data based on the command/data from MCS.
   			- how to do firmware update over the air (FOTA) using MCS.
 - Features of the example project
   - This example demonstrates how to connect to MCS cloud ,receive data and emit IR data.
 - Process / procedure of the example project
   - Connection to MCS server, Keep waiting for the data from server, send IR data using IR emitter.
 - Output from the example
   - IR data will be emitted from the IR emitter connected to the GPIO 33 of 7687 board.
   - Trigger firmware update from MCS console.

@par Hardware and software environment

  - Supported HDK
    - MediaTek LinkIt 7687 HDK.
    -  IR emitter - Connect IR emitter to the GPIO 33 of 7687.

  - PC/environment configuration
   - A serial tool is required, such as hyper terminal, for UART logging.
   - COM port settings : baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity: none and flow control: off.
   - Prepare a Wi-Fi router wtih SSID named as SQA_TEST_AP, whose password is 77777777, and auth mode is WPA_PSK_WPA2_PSK. The Wi-Fi router has the internet connection.

@par Run the demo
  - Connect the board to PC with serial port cable, connect IR emitter to the 7687 board.
  - Build the example project with the command, "./build.sh mt7687_hdk mcs_ir" under the SDK root folder and download the mcs_ir.bin file to LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Power on LinkIt 7687 HDK. It will show log, such as WiFi connection status, MCS logs. Make sure that configured WiFi router is switched ON and has internet connectivity.
  - Go to MCS ( https://mcs.mediatek.com/v2console/) and trigger events from your device prototype - test device.
